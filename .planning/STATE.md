# Project State — @akhil-saxena/design-system

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`
See: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
See: `design_handoff/README.md` (un-tracked, lives in repo) — authoritative 53-section v1.0 spec

## Current Position

Phase: 17 (wave-6-icons-data-display) — EXECUTING
Plan: 9 of 15
**Phase:** Phase 17 — Wave 2 in progress (17-07 complete)
**Last shipped:** v0.5.6 (DatePicker dark-mode hover specificity fix)
**Last anchor commit:** `4d05a9d chore(release): v0.5.6 — dark-mode hover specificity fix` on `main`
**Working tree:** clean

**Progress:** [█████░░░░░] 53%

## Recovery Notes (2026-04-29)

The original `.planning/` was never committed and is lost. This `.planning/` directory was reconstructed from:

1. **`design_handoff/README.md`** (intact in repo, un-tracked) — the 53-section spec authored before implementation began
2. **`design_handoff/JobDash Design System.html`** + 49 `ds-*.jsx` files — visual reference + source-of-truth JSX per section
3. **Git history** of this repo (DS-NN identifiers in commit messages, wave pattern) and sibling `job-dash` repo (phase 1-10 conventions to mirror)
4. **Live `src/` audit** — barrel exports in `src/index.ts` enumerate the 35 shipped primitives

**What is recovered:** PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md (this file), coverage map.
**What is NOT recovered:** Per-phase PLAN / RESEARCH / CONTEXT / DISCUSSION-LOG / VALIDATION docs for phases 13.5, 14, 15, 16. The work is committed and visible in code; the rationale documents are gone.

For phases 13.5–16, treat the git log + commit messages + the `design_handoff/` files as the historical record. For Phase 17 onward, run the normal GSD workflow (`/gsd-discuss-phase`, `/gsd-plan-phase`, etc) to generate fresh per-phase docs.

## Pending Work

**Immediate:** Execute Phase 17 plan set via `/gsd-execute-phase 17`. Wave 0 (17-00) is the gate — every other wave depends on its infra changes.

**Resolved 2026-04-29 (see PROJECT.md "Resolved Scope Decisions"):**

1. ✅ Icons → tree-shakeable `/icons` subpath export (DS-60, Phase 17)
2. ✅ Illustrations → `/illustrations` subpath in same repo (DS-81, Phase 18)
3. ✅ RichText → in Phase 17 on TipTap (DS-70)
4. ✅ Drag & Drop → functional primitive on `@dnd-kit/core` (DS-80, Phase 18)

**Phase 17 commit ordering:** Icons (DS-60) lands first within the phase so DS-61..70 primitives can import canonical components instead of inline SVGs, and previously-shipped primitives can be refactored to use them in the same wave-completion sweep.

## Key Decisions (17-01)

- Brand-lock defaults: size=20, strokeWidth=1.5, color=currentColor applied via spread BEFORE rest props (consumer overrides win)
- 31 icons in barrel (18 current-use + 13 future-Phase-17); stories/*.stories.tsx deferred per D-17-04
- DateRangePicker confirmed zero lucide imports — deferred to 17-02 as designed
- Per-primitive import path: `from "./icons"` (relative from src/ root)

## Key Decisions (17-03)

- WAI-ARIA radiogroup (not tablist) — semantically correct for "one-selected-at-a-time" toggle groups
- `--ink-inverse` token absent from tokens.css; used `#000` directly for amber active text (amber on black is accessible per design handoff)
- `data-active="true"` string value (not boolean) for reliable DOM attribute matching in tests
- Generic `<T extends string>` preserved via `forwardRef` cast — standard TS+React HOC limitation

## Key Decisions (17-06)

- `<ul>`/`<li>` semantic HTML used (not div+role) — biome a11y/useSemanticElements enforcement
- Class-based IntersectionObserver mock in tests — biome reformats bare function expressions to arrow functions, breaking newable mocks
- Consumer `loading` prop is the StrictMode double-effect guard (simpler than a loadingRef)
- `rootMargin: "200px"` default pre-fetches before sentinel reaches viewport edge

## Key Decisions (17-05)

- Connector line between events implemented as CSS `::after` pseudo-element on each `li` (not an extra DOM span) to keep markup clean
- Date formatting via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` — no external date library required
- Event `onClick` wraps inner content in `<button class="ds-atom-timeline-trigger">` — read-only events are bare `li` children

## Key Decisions (17-07)

- `<section aria-labelledby>` used for panels instead of `<div role="region">` — semantic HTML per S6819 lint; identical ARIA role, better device support
- `HEADING_TAGS` lookup table for dynamic heading levels — avoids template-literal cast and nested-template lint warning (S4624)
- `matchMedia` stub added to `test-setup.ts` (Rule 3) — jsdom lacks matchMedia; all future hooks (useColorScheme etc.) benefit automatically
- `fireEvent` used in place of `@testing-library/user-event` — latter not installed; fireEvent sufficient for synchronous click toggle tests

## Blockers / Concerns

- None currently. Working tree clean, 455 tests green after 17-07.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-04-29T23:30:00Z
**Stopped at:** Completed 17-07 — Accordion compound primitive (DS-64), 455 tests green.
**Resume file:** None
**Next command:** `/gsd-execute-phase 17` (proceed to Plan 17-08 onward)
